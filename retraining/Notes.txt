Base for Repo comes from https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection
Datasets used: COCO Dataset, Kitti Dataset, Open Images Dataset, AVA v2.1 dataset, iNaturalist Species Detection Dataset

--> COCO Dataset - Doesn't have a wet floor sign included
Kitti Dataset - Only two classes ???
OpenImages Dataset - Has a Traffic Sign instead?
