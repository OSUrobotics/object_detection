Necessary Installations and versions
Python 3.7
Tensorflow 2.1.0
Opencv-python
Version matters for TensorFlow and python but not OpenCV

To Run:
Download file
Open mainfile.py
Run program and a window should open using your default webcam for image recognition

I got this working on two machines running spyder through anaconda so I would recommend using the same setup to avoid issues.
